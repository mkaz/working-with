# Guessing Game

An example of the guessing game picking a number between 1-100.

## Random umber

The [`math/rand`](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/) standard library is used to generate the random number.

Note, you must seed the generator, for random this is easiest done using `time.Now().UnixNano()`. You can also seed the generator with a known value, such as a user id to get a deterministic random number.

```go
rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
fmt.Println(rand.Intn(100))
```

## Example Game

Here is the example guessing game

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

// automatically called on start
func init() {
    // new random seed
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
}

func main() {
    // variable to store guess
    var guess int

    // variable to store number of guesses
    var count int

    // pick number to guess, add 1 since Intn gives [0,99]
    num := rand.Intn(100) + 1

    fmt.Println(">> I'm thinking of a number between 1-100 << ")

    // guessing loop
    for {
        // prompt user for guess
        fmt.Print("Guess: ")
        _, err := fmt.Scanf("%d", &guess)
        if err == nil {
            count += 1 // increment guess counter
            if guess > num {
                fmt.Println(" >> Too high ")
            } else if guess < num {
                fmt.Println(" >> Too low ")
            } else {
                fmt.Printf("Correct! It took you %d guesses!\n", count)
                break
            }
        } else { // an error with input
            fmt.Println(">> Please input a number")
        }
    }
}
```
