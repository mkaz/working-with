# Working with Files

## Reading File

You can read a complete file in using `ioutil.ReadFile`. See [ReadFile documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/io/ioutil/#ReadFile) The function returns two variables, the first the content of the file. The second variable is the error if one occurred. If no error, than `err` will be `nil`

```go
filename := "./extras/rabbits.txt"

content, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalln("Error reading file", filename)
}
```

The content is returned as a `[]byte` and not a string. You need to cast to a string to use as such, for example to display. Use `string()` to cast a `[]byte` to `string` type.

```
fmt.Println(string(content))
```

## Check if File Exists

One of the above errors can be if the file does not exist. You can use [`os.Stat`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#Stat) to check explicitly if file exists without trying to open.

```go
if _, err := os.Stat("junk.foo"); os.IsNotExist(err) {
    fmt.Println(">>>")
    fmt.Println("File: junk.foo does not exist")
}
```

## Read File Line-by-Line

One way to process a file line by line, would be to read the entire file in, like the first example above, and then split on the line ending.

```go
lines = strings.Split( string(content), "\n" )
```

The above is perfectly fine and works for most files. If you have a large file, for example one that can not be stored in memory, you can use the `bufio` package. See [bufio package](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio) documentaiton.

Here is a way to process a large file line-by-line in golang.

```go
file, err := os.Open(filename)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error opening file: ", err)
}
defer file.Close() // see explanation below

// Use bufio scanner, the default Scan method is by line
scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
for scanner.Scan() {
    line := scanner.Text()
    fmt.Println(line)
}
```

The `defer` statement defers the execution until the surrounding function (or overall program) completes. You should always use `defer` for something that needs to be closed, or cleaned up.

## Write to a new File

Use [`ioutil.WriteFile`](https://golang.org/pkg/io/ioutil/#WriteFile) to write a file out. The function takes three variables, the filename, the content (as a `[]byte`) and the file system mode.

```go
outfile := "output.txt"
err = ioutil.WriteFile(outfile, content, 0644)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error writing file: ", err)
} else {
    fmt.Println(">>>")
    fmt.Println("Created: ", outfile)
}
```

## Append to an existing File

You can write out to an existing file appending the content using the following.

```go
af, err := os.OpenFile(outfile, os.O_APPEND|os.O_WRONLY, 0644)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error appending to file:", err)
}
defer af.Close()
if _, err = af.WriteString("Appending this text"); err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error writing to file:", err)
}
```

## Using Filepath

Use the `filepath` package for working with cross-platform paths properly. See [filepath package](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/) documentaiton. For example, use `filepath.Join` for creating a path with directory.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(filepath.Join("a", "b", "file.ext"))
}
```

See filepath package documentation for additional function, including splitting paths, checking filename extension, base and more.
