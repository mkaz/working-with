# Operators

Here are some basic operators, these are combined with [motions](/working-with-vim/motions/) to edit text:

`y`  
: Yank (copy)

`d`  
: Delete

`p`  
: Put (paste)

`c`  
: Change, deletes and enters INSERT mode

ðŸ’¡ Use `p` paste with something highlighted to replace the highlighted section. This is extremely helpful, since deleting an item can change what is in your register you are trying to paste. See [Registers](/working-with-vim/registers/) for more.

Copy-Paste example

## Undo / Redo

Use `u` for undo, and `ctrl-r` for redo. No motion required, just press the keys in NORMAL or VISUAL mode.

## Uppercase & Lowercase

`gu{motion}`  
: Lowercase test

`gU{motion}`  
: Uppercase text

`g~{motion}`  
: Toggle text case

For example, `gu_` will switch the current line to lowercase, or `g~_` will toggle the case of each character on the current line.

## Indent

See `:help shift-left-right` The brackets `<` and `>` will shift the line one `shiftwidth` length to the left, or right. These can also be paired with VISUAL mode, ranges, and motions.

For example, use `shift-v` to select a line, use arrows or other motions to expand the range, and then type `<` or `>` to shift the lines.

Use `<<` and `>>` to shift using a count. For example, `5>>` will shift 5 lines once to the right. If you want to shift more use `.` to repeat the command.

### Formatting

See `:help =` The `=` command will indent text based on internal formatting rules, or as defined by a plugin for the language. The typical way I use is to highlight the section I want to format using VISUAL mode, and then press `=` to format.

## Repeat That

Press `.` to repeat the last command.

If you start with a number, and then type a command, Vim executes the command that many times. For example, if you want to delete three lines, type `3dd`

## Single Character Operators

`rX`  
: Replace character under cursor with `X`

`x`  
: Delete character under cursor

`~`  
: Toggle case for character under cursor
