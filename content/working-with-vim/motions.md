# Motions

Here are a few of the most common motions. There are many more motions and plugins can define their own, but this is a good start to learn the basics and expand.

`w`  
: Forward to next word

`b`  
: Backward to start of word

`e`  
: Forward to end of word

`fx`  
: Forward to 'x' (cursor on char)

`Fx`  
: Backward to 'x' (cursor on char)

`tx`  
: Forward to 'x' (cursor before char)

`Tx`  
: Backward to 'x' (cursor before char)

`;`  
: Repeat previous motion works with `f F t T`

`_`  
: Current line (underscore)

Practice the basic motions by just pressing the motion character(s), while in NORMAL mode the cursor will move. So, pressing `w` moves the cursor forward to the next word. You can precede any motion with a number, for example `5w` will move forward to the fifth next word.

When you put an operator first, it will perform that action on the motion. For example, `dw` will delete to the next word, this includes the space, not just the word.

ðŸ’¡ There are minor differences between `w` and `e`; as well as between `f` and `t`. The differences are where the cursor ends up. This can be important depending on the operator. For example, `dfx` will delete forward up to and including the `x` character, whereas `dtx` will delete up to but not including the `x`.

You can visualize the motions by starting with `v` and then the motion, it will highlight the selected area. See the difference between `ve` highlighting to the end of the word, to `vw` highlighting to the next word.

## Window Motions

Here are a set of window motions, primarily used for navigating. The motions jump to different sections of the visible window, not the document, so cursor movement occurs without the document scrolling.

`H`  
: High, jump to top of window

`M`  
: Middle, jump to middle of window

`L`  
: Low, jump to bottom of window

`zz`  
: Window is positioned so current line is centered vertically, cursor does not jump
